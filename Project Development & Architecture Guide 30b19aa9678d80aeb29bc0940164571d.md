# Project Development & Architecture Guide

Welcome to the team! This guide is designed to help you understand our project structure and how to build new features or even start a new project using our **Feature-based Organization**.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Our projects follow a **Feature-based Organization**. Instead of grouping code by technical layers (all controllers here, all services there), we group everything by **Business Feature**.

This structure focuses on a simple, direct flow:

```
Controller (API/Web) → Service (Domain Logic) → Database (EF Core)
```

---

### High-Level Project Structure

The solution is divided into several projects:

1. **`Project.Api`**
    
    The RESTful API layer. Controllers here receive requests and call the corresponding Domain Service.
    
2. **`Project.Domain`**
    
    The heart of the application. It contains all business logic organized by **Features**.
    
3. **`Project.WebApp`**
    
    The frontend UI (Blazor). Pages here interact with Domain Services or the API.
    
4. **`Project.Shared`**
    
    Common utilities, constants, and the **Result Pattern** models used by everyone.
    
5. **`Project.Database`**
    
    Entity Framework Core context, migrations, and database scripts.

## 📂 Deep Dive: Feature-based Organization

Every business module (e.g., User Management, Orders) is a folder under `Features/` in the Domain project.

---

### Anatomy of a Feature Folder

Inside a feature folder (e.g., `Features/Invoices`), you will find:

- **`Models/`**: Contains Request and Response DTOs specific to this feature.
- **`[FeatureName]Service.cs`**: The service class containing all methods for this feature (Create, Get, Update, Delete).

---

## 🔄 The Result Pattern

We don't return raw data or throw exceptions for business logic errors. Instead, we use a **Result Pattern**. Every service method should return a `Result<T>` or `Result` object.

### Example Service Method

```csharp
public async Task<Result<InvoiceResponse>> CreateInvoiceAsync(InvoiceRequest request)
{
    // 1. Logic
    // 2. Database save with EF Core
    // 3. Return Result.Success(data) or Result.Failure(error)
}
```

## 🚀 Step-by-Step: Starting a New Project

Follow these steps to initialize a new project with our structure:

### Step 1: Create the Solution and Projects

1. Create a blank .NET Solution.
2. Add the following:
    - **ASP.NET Core Web API** (`.Api`)
    - **Class Library** (`.Domain` and `.Shared`)
    - **Blazor Web App** (`.WebApp`)

---

### Step 2: Set Up References

- `.Domain` references `.Shared` and `.Database`.
- `.Api` and `.WebApp` reference `.Domain`.

---

### Step 3: Organize the Domain

1. In the `.Domain` project, create a `Features/` folder.
2. Inside `Features/`, create your feature folder (e.g., `ProductCatalog/`).
3. Inside that, create a `Models/` folder.

---

### Step 4: Implement the Service

1. Create your Service class (e.g., `ProductService.cs`) directly inside the feature folder.
2. Use Entity Framework Core directly in the service to perform CRUD operations.
3. Use the **Result Pattern** for all return types.

## 💡 Tips for Junior Developers

1. **One Feature, One Folder**
    
    Everything related to a feature should stay inside its folder.
    
2. **Service Responsibility**
    
    Keep your business logic in the Service, not in the Controller or the UI.
    
3. **Result, Not Exceptions**
    
    Use `Result.Failure("Error message")` for things like "User not found" or "Insufficient balance". Reserve Exceptions for truly unexpected system crashes.
    
4. **Keep it Simple**
    
    No need for complex patterns like Mediator or CQRS. Just call the service method you need.
    
5. **Small Commits**
    
    Small changes are easier to review and harder to break.

Happy coding! If you're stuck, remember:
